# Fetch Opportunity Stage Name Values
This api can be used to fetch the selected stage name picklist values according to the Sales Processes. It is built with NodeJS backend.

### Prerequisites
In order to work with this api you'll need the following installed on your machine:
* Node.js and NPM – Note, NVM is the preferred way to go as it allows to easily control the version of Node you're running with. [More info in this article](https://medium.com/@itsromiljain/the-best-way-to-install-node-js-npm-and-yarn-on-mac-osx-4d8a8544987a).

### .env file setup

* PORT = `Port on which the code has to run - Default 3000`
* USERNAME = `username of a valid salesforce org user`
* PASSWORD = `password of a valid salesforce org user`

### Install Node dependencies
